So you start building usingÂ **serverless**Â principles, and you discover theÂ [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/). Great ! You will discover here another option, that I consider superior in multiple area, theÂ [Serverless Stack (SST)](https://serverless-stack.com/). In this second article, I will focus on some availableÂ *constructs*Â after introducing the concept. It can help you to build faster!

## Introducing some concepts

### What is CDK?

TheÂ [Serverless Stack (SST)](https://serverless-stack.com/)Â is based on theÂ [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). This solution has been introduced by AWS a few years ago, it allow to buildÂ *infrastructure as code (IaC)*Â by using a real programming language. If you already knowÂ [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), it is an equivalent product.

Terraform allow you to declare cloud resources via theÂ *HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)*:

```plain
resource "aws_instance" "iac_in_action" {
  ami               = var.ami_id
  instance_type     = var.instance_type
  availability_zone = var.availability_zone

  // dynamically retrieve SSH Key Name
  key_name = aws_key_pair.iac_in_action.key_name

  // dynamically set Security Group ID (firewall)
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.iac_in_action.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-managed EC2 Instance for IaC in Action"
  }
}
```

On the opposite CDK allow you to declare cloud resources viaÂ *TypeScript*,Â *Python*,Â *Java*Â orÂ *.Net*Â (maybe more now?)!

```plain
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-ec2';
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';

export class CdkStarterStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // ... rest

    // ðŸ‘‡ create the EC2 Instance
    const ec2Instance = new ec2.Instance(this, 'ec2-instance', {
      vpc,
      vpcSubnets: {
        subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,
      },
      role: webserverRole,
      securityGroup: webserverSG,
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(
        ec2.InstanceClass.T2,
        ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO,
      ),
      machineImage: new ec2.AmazonLinuxImage({
        generation: ec2.AmazonLinuxGeneration.AMAZON_LINUX_2,
      }),
      keyName: 'ec2-key-pair',
    });
  }
}
```

*(this is a TypeScript example from*Â [_here_](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/aws-cdk-ec2-instance-example)_)._

A few more differences exists between the solutions:

- *Terraform*Â can deploy on any supported cloud provider butÂ *CDK*Â is designed to work only on AWS (some tooling exist to break this limit, but it's not the goal of this article!)
- CDK is relying on CloudFormation template and stacks, so theÂ *state*Â of your infrastructure is directly stored in CloudFormation stacks (not in a local json file or a S3 bucket, classic solutions for Terraform)

This will be enough to introduce you the next important concept:Â *constructs*!

### What are constructs?

FromÂ [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html):

> Constructs are the basic building blocks of AWS CDK apps. A construct represents a "cloud component" and encapsulates everything AWS CloudFormation needs to create the component.

You can think about a set of basic cloud resources are managed behind a construct, and it help you to handle the complexity more easily with a few low number of lines.

For exampleÂ [here](https://awscdk.io/packages/@aws-cdk/aws-ecs-patterns@1.95.1/#/)Â we can see how it's possible to use the constructÂ `ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService`Â in a few lines of codes:

```plain
const loadBalancedFargateService = new ecsPatterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(stack, 'Service', {
  cluster,
  memoryLimitMiB: 1024,
  cpu: 512,
  taskImageOptions: {
    image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample"),
  },
});
```

This single object is responsible to create the following:

- a ECS task definition
- a ECS service based on Fargate
- an Application Load Balancer

And it can also generate for you a ECS Cluster if you provide a VPC. So in justÂ **8**Â lines you create not less than 4 or 5 AWS resources!

### Constructs Provided By SST

As said previously SST is based on CDK so it use intrinsically all CDK concepts, includingÂ *Constructs*.

One example provided in the firstÂ [article](https://dev.to/julbrs/sst-the-most-underrated-serverless-framework-you-need-to-discover-25ne)Â was using theÂ `Api`Â object, it's probably the most basic SST Construct available! Let's get a view on the most important constructs available in the framework and understand how it can help you.

![[sst3.png]]
(*Go*Â [_here_](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/)Â *to get the full list!*)

### Api

```plain
const api = new Api(this, "Api", {
  routes: {
    "GET  /notes": "src/list.main",
    "POST /notes": "src/create.main",
  },
})
```

The most simple one, to declare API HTTP endpoints very quickly. It mimics what can be done in the classicÂ *Serverless Framework*. See myÂ [first article](https://dev.to/julbrs/sst-the-most-underrated-serverless-framework-you-need-to-discover-25ne)Â for a more in-depth comparison.

### Auth

```plain
import { Auth } from "@serverless-stack/resources";

const auth = new Auth(this, "Auth", {
  cognito: true,
});
```

*Auth*Â will allow you to manage user authentication on your application, API... It's based on AWS services:Â [Cognito User Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html)Â andÂ [Cognito Identity Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html).

You can then manage the permissions:

```plain
auth.attachPermissionsForAuthUsers([
  api,
]);
```

Authenticated user of theÂ `auth`Â object will be allowed to access the API endpoints declared by theÂ `api`Â object (you need toÂ [secure](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/constructs/Api#adding-auth)Â your API for that, by default API is not secured and everyone can use it).

### Table

TheÂ [Table](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/constructs/Table)Â construct will handle for you a DynamoDB table:

```plain
import { Table, TableFieldType } from "@serverless-stack/resources";

const table = new Table(this, "Notes", {
  fields: {
    userId: TableFieldType.STRING,
    noteId: TableFieldType.STRING,
  },
  primaryIndex: { partitionKey: "noteId", sortKey: "userId" },
});
```

Then if you want to allow the Lambda functions inside yourÂ `api`Â object to be able to read / write in the table you have to specify that with theÂ `permissions`Â prop:

```plain
new Api(this, "Api", {
  defaultFunctionProps: {
    permissions: [table],
  },
  routes: {
    "GET  /notes": "src/list.main",
    "POST /notes": "src/create.main",
  },
});
```

### ReactStaticSite

[ReactStaticSite](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/constructs/ReactStaticSite)Â is a very cleaver constructs that will allow you to include your frontend application inside the SST application!

Let's imagine you have aÂ `frontend/`Â folder inside the SST application with a classicÂ *ReactJs*Â application. Add the following to your SST stack:

```plain
const site = new ReactStaticSite(this, "ReactSite", {
  path: "frontend/",
});
```

This 3-lines of code will do the following:

- create for you aÂ **S3 bucket**Â to host the frontend files
- create for you aÂ **CloudFront deployment**Â to manage a CDN for your frontend
- **build**Â your ReactJs application when you are deploying the application (`sst deploy`)
- **push to S3**Â the build version of your ReactJs application to the S3 bucket dedicated
- **invalidate**Â the CloudFront deployment (to get ride of existing cached data on the CDN)

And you can also imagine the power behind theÂ [StaticSite](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/constructs/StaticSite)Â or theÂ [NextjsSite](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/constructs/NextjsSite)Â constructs ðŸ˜…

### Handle Environment Variables with ReactStaticSite

Generally you will use someÂ `REACT_APP_*`Â variables in your ReactJs application in order to share the URL endpoint of your API, the Cognito User Pool Id, etc... A classic way to do that is to create aÂ `.env`Â file at the root level of your ReactJs application ([here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env)Â for Create React App documentation)

SST is providing a very efficient way to handle that without messing with aÂ `.env`Â file anymore! First define the variable in theÂ `ReactStaticSite`Â construct like that:

```plain
new ReactStaticSite(this, "ReactSite", {
  path: "path/to/src",
  environment: {
    REACT_APP_API_URL: api.url,
    REACT_APP_USER_POOL_CLIENT: auth.cognitoUserPoolClient.userPoolClientId,
  },
});
```

Then in combination with theÂ [Live Lambda Development](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/live-lambda-development)Â environment (it will be my next article!) you will be able to start your local React application by using the SST live information!

Add the following package to your ReactJs application:

```plain
npm install --save-dev @serverless-stack/static-site-env
```

And change theÂ `start`Â script inÂ `package.json`:

```plain
"scripts": {
  "start": "sst-env -- react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
```

More on this feature in theÂ [dedicated documentation](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/constructs/ReactStaticSite#configuring-environment-variables).

## Conclusion

This is the end of this second article about SST framework. I hope you understand better the power behind eachÂ *construct*Â provided by the framework. The team behind is very active and ship new features very often. I remember a few months ago, saying to myself: "if only some kind of static site could be embed into SST it will be justÂ *magic*". Then I seeÂ [v0.33.0](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack/releases/tag/v0.33.0)Â ðŸ˜±.

Just give a look at the follow resources:

- [documentation](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/)Â which is top notch
- [guide](https://serverless-stack.com/#guide)Â that contains a lot of examples, and some comparison with Serverless Framework

In the next episode of this series, I will speak about the local development feature of this framework, you canÂ [follow me](https://twitter.com/_julbrs)Â to be informed when it will be out!
