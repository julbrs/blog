My name is Julien Bras, I’m a **software developer** with a particular interest in **technical writing**.

### In a nutshell

I am currently working for [Wiiisdom](https://wiiisdom.com/) as **Innovation Manager**, with a software development team to deliver **solutions** used by **Wiiisdom customers and employees**. I am also member of the [Draft.dev](http://draft.dev/) **writer team**, creating blog post around multiple technical subjects (cloud platform, analytics, testing...).

## Anything else?

I live currently in ~~Montréal~~ Sherbrooke, QC 🍁. I have 3 kids (⇒ lot of fun 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  but still no emoji with 3 kids!). I run, [sometimes](https://statistik.d-u-v.org/getresultperson.php?runner=803064) 😅 , but only slowly and long ones!
